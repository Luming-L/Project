ATAC-seq计数矩阵，原始矩阵和归一化矩阵

# 20200417
1. FIMO(PRDM9 motif finding)/HINT-ATAC(footprinting + PRDM9 motif finding)
2.  compare 
3. classify the motifs founded by alleles of PRDM9
4. Relate PRDM9 expression (PRDM9 read counts) to the presence of PRDM9 ATAC-Seq peaks (number of peaks? kinds of PRDM9 motifs) by linear model (?) 
5. Relate ATAC-Seq presence to mutation data in the TCGA (copy number and somatic mutations) (how to quatify the mutations?) by linear model (?)
