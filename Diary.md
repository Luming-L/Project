1. FIMO(PRDM9 motif finding)/HINT-ATAC(footprinting and PRDM9 motif finding)
2. Relate PRDM9 expression (PRDM9 read counts) to the presence of PRDM9 ATAC-Seq peaks (number of peaks? kinds of PRDM9 motifs) by linear model (?) 
3. Relate ATAC-Seq presence to mutation data, i.e. structural variant calls in the TCGA
