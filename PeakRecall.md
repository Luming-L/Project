# rationale
In macs2, the `call peak` function can be decomposed to a series of subcommands. These subcommands follow these steps: Filter duplicates, Decide the fragment length d, Extend ChIP sample to get ChIP coverage track, Build local bias track from control, Scale the ChIP and control to the same sequencing depth
