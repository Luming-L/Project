Visualize the overlap between PRDM9 binding regions in cancer cells and those in testes: This step starts from the PRDM9 binding regions in 404 tumour samples and in testes. A histogram will be plotted to visualize the distribution of overlap fraction between regions in each cancer sample and testes. The x axis of this histogram is 0 to 100% overlap, and the y axis is number of samples.
