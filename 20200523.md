# bigWig Track Format
## definition
bigWig is used to store dense, continuous data that will be displayed in the Genome Browser as a graph.
# BedGraph Track Format
## definition
BedGraph is used to display continuous-valued data in track format. BedGraph can be transformed to bigWig to save time for displaying.
## General Structure
```
chromA  chromStartA  chromEndA  dataValueA
chromB  chromStartB  chromEndB  dataValueB
```
> each line describes consecutive positions with the same coverage
> chromStartA  to chromEndA: consecutive positions
> dataValue: coverage

# BigWig file in this paper
normalized bigWig files for visualization of ATAC-seq tracks for each individual technical replicate
The provided bigWig files have been normalized by the total insertions in peaks and then binned into 100-bp bins. Each 100-bp bin represents the normalized number of insertions that occurred within the corresponding 100 bp.
