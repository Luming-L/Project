BigWig - bedgraph - peak p-value - peak region
# BigWig file in this paper
normalized bigWig files for visualization of ATAC-seq tracks for each individual technical replicate
The provided bigWig files have been normalized by the total insertions in peaks and then binned into 100-bp bins. Each 100-bp bin represents the normalized number of insertions that occurred within the corresponding 100 bp.
