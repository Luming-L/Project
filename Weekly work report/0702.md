## correlate PRDM9 expression with PRDM9-binding
1. used PRDM9-bound peaks to represent PRDM9 binding
2. will use fimo output to represent PRDM9 binding later
3. just 25% samples have PRDM9 expression (7% samples don't have RNA-seq data)
## choose COAD to study PRDM9 expression, PRDM9 binding and mutations
1. not noticeable relationship just by looking with eyes
## tweak parameters of peakRecall.py
1. can recover more than 99% reproducible peaks for each type of cancer
