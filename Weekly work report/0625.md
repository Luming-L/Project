1. tweak the parameters of bdgpeakcall
`-c 3 -l 400`
**Q:** indicate the variation of peak signal in samples

2.  Plot overlap fraction distribution
3. permutation test
```r
pt <- permTest(A=peaks, B=mutations, ntimes=100000, randomize.function=circularRandomizeRegions,
                evaluate.function=numOverlaps, count.once=TRUE, verbose=FALSE)
```
$numOverlaps
P-value: 0.216783216783217
Z-score: 1.4958
Number of iterations: 1000
Alternative: greater
Evaluation of the original region set: 1
Evaluation function: numOverlaps
Randomization function: circularRandomizeRegions

**Q:**
- what is set as A and what is B
- library(regioneR)
- time
