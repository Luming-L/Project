1. tweak the parameters of bdgpeakcall
`-c 3 -l 400`
**Q:** indicate the variation of peak signal in samples

2.  Plot overlap fraction distribution
number of motifs in PRDM9 bound peaks
divide by peak number
annotate peaks compare testis with cancer pie chart

4. permutation test
```r
pt <- permTest(A=peaks, B=mutations, ntimes=10000, randomize.function=circularRandomizeRegions,
                evaluate.function=numOverlaps, count.once=TRUE, verbose=FALSE)
```
mutations acound the peaks 
$numOverlaps
P-value: 0.216783216783217
Z-score: 1.4958
Number of iterations: 1000
Alternative: greater
Evaluation of the original region set: 1
Evaluation function: numOverlaps
Randomization function: circularRandomizeRegions

**Q:**
- what is set as A and what is B
- library(regioneR)
- time


filter samples 
copy number
choose the data set
