Data:
404 donors
410 samples
796 replicates = 386 technical replicate pairs (772) + 24 single replicate samples 

Donor – An individual person. Multiple tumor samples can come from a single donor.
Sample – A piece of tumor tissue. Multiple technical replicates can exist per sample.
Technical Replicate – Tumor tissue was homogenized prior to ATAC-seq into a nuclei suspension. Each technical replicate represents an individual ATAC-seq reaction performed in a separate tube on different nuclei isolated from the same sample.

score
The score (5th) column contains 10 times of the average score in the broad region
MACS will now reanalyze the shape of signal profile (p or q-score depending on the cutoff setting) to deconvolve subpeaks within each peak called from the general procedure. It's highly recommended to detect adjacent binding events. While used, the output subpeaks of a big peak region will have the same peak boundaries, and different scores and peak summit positions.
