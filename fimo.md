`sequence file`
# Output
# Result
## ACC
79801 motif occurences with a p-value less than 0.0001
Each line stands for each significant match to a motif.
The lines are sorted in order of decreasing statistical significance (increasing _p_-value).

p-value
q-value: The _p_-values for each motif occurrence are converted to _q_-values following the method of Benjamini and Hochberg ("_q_-value" is defined as the minimal false discovery rate at which a given motif occurrence is deemed significant).
